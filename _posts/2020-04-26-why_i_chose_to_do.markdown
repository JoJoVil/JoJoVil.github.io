Hello everyone! I am a certified teacher working as a teacher assistant at an east end high school. I came to the conclusion some time ago that I was never going to get a job as a teacher on Long Island. I have been at this for six years; applied to hundreds of jobs and I couldn't get one interview ! (*I guess I just don't know the right people!* )

Since I have always been interested in technology and learning new programs, I thought it would be a great idea to pursue a career in that field, but I did not want to go back to school and learn the traditional way. Flatiron is giving me the opportunity and knowledge that I need to pursue this career. I know that this will change my life in so many ways!!

Maybe next year I'll be able to take that much needed vacation with my family!
