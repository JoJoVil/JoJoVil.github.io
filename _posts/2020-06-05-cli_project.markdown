Well I just completed my CLI Project. I did something very simple (getting conversion rates from 51 currency codes). I wanted to do something simple because I am still trying to get a handle on all we've learned in the past few weeks. I am definitely in that imposter mode that everyone is talking about!! I hope to get through the assessment next week without stumbling over my words too much!!! Just feeling a little nervous - that's all!
